##Q: What is Hack && Tell?

H&&T is a show and tell style meetup for hackers!

Events are structured such that 8â€”10 hackers give 5 minute long presentations on something they built, and then respond to Q&A for 5 more minutes.

Presentations of almost any kind of hack are encouraged, but we do not allow 1) startup pitches or 2) work projects.

We want to promote the projects that people do in their spare time, for fun, or utility, and not the kinds of projects that are only applicable to people who work in your company, or your direct clients. On the other hand, there may be a project that you've built primarily at work, that solves a *general* problem that your company has allowed you to release with a libre license -- this is usually fine.

##Q: What is a hacker?

We go by the old school definition according to RFC 1392: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.

That's it.

A person who (1) delights in (2) having an intimate understanding of (3) the internal workings of a system, (4) computers and computer networks in particular.

##Q: Do you have to already have an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system?

NO! All we ask is that you enjoy exploring and learning more than you have to just to get by. It's as simple as that.

You don't have to be employed as a developer.

You don't have to be an expert.

You don't have to be a genius.

You don't have to have a CS degree, or any degree at all.

If you DELIGHT in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular, you are a hacker!

Yes, you are.

##Q: Could I start a Hack && Tell in <city>?

Yep! We will tell you how after we cover the code of conduct.
